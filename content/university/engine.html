            <h2>JAVASCRIPT GAME ENGINE</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to create a library from scratch that I 
                could use to build games entirely out of HTML5 elements implemented 
                in javascript. I modelled the engine code off of my prior experience 
                using game engines such as unity, therefore some of the code resembles 
                methods you might see when using such game engines.
                <br><br>
                The engine centres around a core update loop which iterates over all entities 
                that currently exist. I created an entity class which is intended to be used 
                as a parent class for all objects inside of the game. Animation sprites are 
                stored in a folder and the references to these sprites are stored in a json file 
                where they are ordered by the animations that they are a part of. 
                <br><br>
                An example game is playable at the bottom of this page. The game is a version of snake. 
                Although this is a very simple example which doesnt take advantage of animation for 
                most of the sprites (excluding the apple), more complex games are possible and the engine 
                itself has plenty of room for expansion. Such as supporting UI elements and a more sophisticated 
                saving and loading implementation to allow for more complex levels inside of the engine.
                <br><br>
