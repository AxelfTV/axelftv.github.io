        <h2>Mathematical Methods of Procedural Terrain Generation</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../assets/images/fypex.png" alt="Procedurally generated terrain">
            In the realm of digital environments, the creation of realistic and captivating terrains
            is a fundamental aspect of many applications, ranging from video games to simulation
            software and virtual reality experiences. Traditionally, the construction of terrain models
            relied heavily on manual design or predefined algorithms, limiting the scope of generated
            landscapes and often requiring extensive human intervention.
            However, in recent years, procedural content generation has emerged as a powerful
            alternative. By employing mathematical algorithms and procedural techniques, this approach allows for the automatic generation of vast and diverse terrains, 
            offering unparalleled
            scalability and flexibility. Moreover, procedural terrain generation enables the creation of
            dynamic landscapes that can adapt to various parameters, offering a more immersive and
            interactive experience for users.
            In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of procedural terrain generation
            from a mathematical standpoint. Our objective is to explore the underlying principles and
            techniques involved in generating realistic terrains algorithmically. 
            By leveraging mathematical concepts such as noise functions, and model synthesis, we aim to develop a deep
            understanding of how terrain features can be generated procedurally and how mathematical
            principles govern their appearance and behavior.
            Through this project, we intend to accomplish the following objectives:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Understanding Terrain Generation Algorithms: </b>
                We will study various algorithms commonly used in procedural terrain generation, including Perlin noise, wave
                function collapse, marching cubes,and various methods of interpolation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Implementation and Experimentation: </b>
                We will implement these algorithms
                and experiment with different parameters to observe their effects on the generated
                terrains. Through coding and simulation, we will gain insights into the interplay
                between mathematical parameters and terrain characteristics.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Analysis and Evaluation: </b>
                We will critically analyze the generated terrains, evaluating their realism, visual appeal, and suitability for specific applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Application and Future Directions: </b>
                Finally, we will discuss potential applications of procedural terrain generation across various domains, including gaming,
                virtual reality, and scientific simulations. Furthermore, we will explore avenues for
                future research and development in this exciting field.

            The goal of this project was to create a library from scratch that I could use to build games entirely out of HTML5 elements implemented in javascript.
            I modelled the engine code off of my prior experience using game engines such as unity, therefore some of the code resembles methods you might see when using such game engines.    
        </p>
        <p>
            I have recreated the game "Snake" using this library as an example of the engine's capabilities although more complicated projects are certainly doable.
